A prequel to my former modpack, Biotechnica, it contains it's basics, Exploration and Technology. But I wanted to go further:

I made this project for personal use in the first place, but I'm happy if you enjoy it or even want to contribute. Feel free to ask for new things too. 
I would only ask that the images (icons, logo, buttons, disks...) and the name of the modpack remain mine.
